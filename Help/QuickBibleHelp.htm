				</em><strong>QuickBible</strong> is designed to create instant presentation slides
            of scripture.&nbsp; These slides can be displayed on any monitor that is connected
            to the system. &nbsp;&nbsp;If an overhead projector is connected to the system as a monitor
            then this allows you to display slides to an audience.</P>
        <p>
			<strong>QuickBible</strong> is composed of 4 main functions.&nbsp; These 
			are:&nbsp; 1) The main Worksheet and settings along with associated functions, 
			2) The preview and overhead windows, 3) The color and background configuration 
			dialog, and 4) The search dialog.&nbsp; Depending on your edition, <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			will allow you to display verses in a preview and a main display.&nbsp; All 
			versions have a preview window, but only the Basic and Full editions have the 
			main display.&nbsp; The Lite and Personal editions only have the preview 
			display.&nbsp; This display is perfect for previewing verses for reading or for 
			slide preparation.&nbsp; A useful configuration of different editions of <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			might have the backoffice using the Lite or Personal editions for saving off 
			verse lists for later displaying on the Basic or Full editions of <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			.&nbsp; The Basic edition will allow you to search for words or phrases to help 
			you locate information based on a theme.&nbsp; Perhaps you want to display 
			different verses about tithing but your audience is tired of hearing the same 
			verse over and over.&nbsp; You can find all verses related to tithing by 
			searching for 'tithe', 'tithing', or a variant of the word.&nbsp; All editions 
			except for the Lite version have searching and only the Basic and Full editions 
			have&nbsp;verse by&nbsp;verse settings.<br>

			<strong>QuickBible</strong> manages&nbsp;verse using the Worksheet and the 
			controls in the Add, Delete, File, and Find It groups.&nbsp; These features 
			work by adding and deleting verses to and from the Worksheet, loading and 
			saving verses in the Worksheet for later access, and searching the scripture 
			for a word or phrase.<br>

				QuickBible</strong> can quickly update it in four ways.&nbsp; These are: 1) 
			By clicking the Refresh button, 2) By pressing ALT + F keyboard combination, 3) 
			By using the left and right arrow keys to move through the worksheet, 4) By 
			clicking the verse column in the Settings view.</p>

			The <strong>QuickBible</strong> Worksheet is used to list and arrange the 
			verses that will be displayed on the overhead projection system.&nbsp; The 
			overhead projection system is hooked up to the computer as a primary or 
			secondary monitor.&nbsp; The <strong>QuickBible</strong> Worksheet is organized 
			with the columns of <EM>Translation</EM>, <EM>Book</EM>, <EM>Chapter</EM>, <EM>From</EM>
			<EM>Verse</EM>, <EM>To Verse</EM>, and <EM>Scripture</EM>.&nbsp; The <EM>Translation</EM>
			column displays which Bible translation is being used.&nbsp; The <EM>Book</EM> column 
			displays which book of the Bible is being used.&nbsp; The <EM>Chapter</EM> column 
			displays which chapter of the book is being used.&nbsp; The <EM>From Verse</EM> 
			and <EM>To Verse</EM> columns display the beginning and ending verse being used 
			from the chapter.&nbsp; The Worksheet can be navigated with the arrow 
			keys.&nbsp; Using the up and down arrows moves the highlighted selection.&nbsp; 
			Moving the left and right arrows moves the highlighted selection and displays 
			the highlighted verse in the preview window if it is turned on.<br>

						<a name="EditScripture">Editing the Verses</a></span></strong></em><br>
			<br>
			<strong>QuickBible</strong> allows editing the <EM>Translation</EM>, <EM>Book</EM>,
			<EM>Chapter</EM>, <EM>From Verse</EM>, and <EM>To Verse</EM> settings to 
			customize the verse that will be displayed.&nbsp; Verses can be displayed in 
			the Preview window or on the Main window.&nbsp; The Main window refers to the 
			main display screen which could be an overhead projecter or a second 
			monitor.&nbsp; There are two types of edits allowed: 1) Rapid entry and 2) 
			Regular entry.&nbsp; Rapid entry consists of editing the fields with the 
			keyboard and using the Tab key to accept the edit and move to the next 
			field.&nbsp; Rapid entry also does predictive completion of the translation and 
			book, which means that only the first few letters of these fields need to be 
			typed before <strong>QuickBible</strong> has&nbsp;predicted the right text. 
			&nbsp;Rapid entry can be exited by pressing the Enter key, which causes the 
			current edit to be accepted.&nbsp; While editing a field, pressing Tab moves to 
			the next field and pressing Shift + Tab moves to the previous field.&nbsp; In 
			regular entry, the possible&nbsp;choices are displayed in a selection 
			list.&nbsp; Selection lists include:&nbsp;1) Translations of the Bible, 2) 
			Books of the Bible, 3) Chapters and Verses of the Bible.<br>

			The <strong>QuickBible</strong> &nbsp;Display Settings are used to customize 
			all verses that will be displayed.&nbsp; These settings apply to all verses and 
			control the font, size, justification, image,&nbsp;color settings, and slide 
			transitions.&nbsp; Fonts are changed using a selection list.&nbsp; The font can 
			be sized automatically or it can be given a static setting.&nbsp; When fonts 
			are sized automatically, they are&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;a point size that 
			shouldn't be exceeded when they are being fit to the display.&nbsp; This is 
			very useful for normalizing all the slides in way that keeps the font 
			perspective the same between slides.&nbsp; Justification occurs with the Center 
			checkbox, and if this is checked then center justification is in effect. 
			Otherwise, left justification is in effect.&nbsp; The Text and Back buttons 
			control the text and background color of the verse.&nbsp; The Background button 
			controls the background image or secondary background color to be blended with 
			the primary background color.&nbsp; This is very useful for creating 
			professional looking slides in which the verse is not overpowered by the 
			background image.&nbsp; Slide transitions control how slides are shown.&nbsp; 
			When transitions are on, the slide that the verse is on will fade in and out at 
			a rate that can be chosen on the Image Settings dialog.<br>
			<br>
			<em><strong>The Display Settings Group</strong></em><br>
			<IMG src="DisplaySettings.jpg"><br>
			<br>
			The <strong>QuickBible</strong> verse settings are used to customize verses 
			that will be displayed.&nbsp; These settings are identical in function to the 
			display settings.&nbsp; <strong>QuickBible</strong> verse settings are applied 
			on a verse by verse basis and can be turned on or off.&nbsp; When turned on, 
			the verse setting is used in the display of the verse.&nbsp; Verse 
			customization is useful when you want to plan ahead and have different fonts, 
			backgrounds, colors, alignments, and justifications for your verses.&nbsp; 
			Settings are edited by clicking on the property within the settings list and on 
			the verse of interest.&nbsp; Verse settings are edited differently depending on 
			the setting that is being edited.&nbsp; The <EM>Use</EM>, <EM>Auto</EM> <EM>Size</EM>,
			<EM>Center, </EM>and<EM> Transition Slides</EM>&nbsp;column settings have only 
			a "Yes" or "No" choice that is presented in a selection list.&nbsp; The <EM>Background</EM>,
			<EM>Text</EM>, and <EM>Back</EM> settings go directly to the dialogs that edit 
			image settings, text, and background colors.&nbsp; These settings can be 
			changed in the dialog or canceled out and left as they were before editing 
			began.&nbsp; The <EM>Font</EM> setting provides a selection list of&nbsp;fonts 
			that are currently installed to the system.&nbsp; These include True Type, 
			Raster, and Device fonts. The <EM>Point Size</EM> and <EM>Point Max</EM> settings 
			are edited by typing in new values for the&nbsp;font point size in the event of 
			autosizing being turned off, or the maximum point size not to exceed in case 
			autosizing is turned on.</P>

            font selection by moving around in the list.&nbsp; You can change the point size
            of the font by editing the size.&nbsp; You can scroll around the sample text area
            to see how the entire alphabet and numbers will be displayed.&nbsp; Not all computers
            have the same fonts installed so if you plan on sharing <strong>QuickBible</strong>
            bible files (.bbl) with others you should make sure that they have your fonts installed.</p>

			The Image Settings dialog allows specific control of the background of the 
			display.&nbsp; Verses&nbsp;are displayed over background images to achieve a 
			professional slide presentation. &nbsp;<strong>QuickBible</strong> supports all 
			major image file formats.&nbsp; Sometimes a background image will overpower the 
			verse that is being overlaid.&nbsp; It is important to understand how <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			presents verse on a background image.&nbsp; <strong>QuickBible</strong> uses a 
			graphical concept known as alphablending.&nbsp; Alphablending combines two 
			images together using a transparency setting and the end result is that one 
			image will appear as a silouhette on the other.&nbsp; <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			will use the main background color as the silouhette to blend in to the 
			background image using the transparency setting.&nbsp; Look at the example of 
			the preview below to see how an image and an orangeish color were used to 
			effectively display the verse on the image of the desert cavern.&nbsp; <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			is not limited to blending and image and a solid color. &nbsp;Two solid colors 
			can also be blended. Blending in <strong>QuickBible</strong> can also be turned 
			off. &nbsp; Blending transparency is the percentage of the foreground that does 
			not allow the background to show through.&nbsp; A transparency percentage of 
			100 will create an opaque background, while a transparency percentage of 0 will 
			create a transparent background.&nbsp; A transparency in between will control 
			how the color is blended from full transparency to full opacity.</p>

			<strong>QuickBible</strong> allows you to display the verse in the Preview and 
			Main display.&nbsp; Depending on your needs, multiple copies of <strong>QuickBible</strong>
			can be running.&nbsp; The Preview version is a miniature version of what is 
			displayed on the main, overhead display.&nbsp; When previewing slides that 
			contain background images, some loss of quality will occur in the slide to 
			accomodate shrinking the image to the Preview display size.&nbsp; The preview 
			display is resizable, and the larger the Preview display, the more accurately 
			it will reflect what will be displayed on the Main display. &nbsp;This is 
			especially true of verse autosizing in which the main display will be able to 
			display the verse at a larger point size.&nbsp; The Preview and Main displays 
			can be turned on and off by pressing the On and Off buttons in the Preview and 
			Main Display groups.<br>
